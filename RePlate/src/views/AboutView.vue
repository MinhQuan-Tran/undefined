    <p class="description">
      RePlate aims to eliminate food waste and foster community values by bridging the gap between businesses with surplus food and individuals and charities who can use it. Whether we are connecting bakeries with unsold pastries or a restuarant with extra meals, we make it easy for them to connect with local organisations and people in real time. Businesses reduce waste, and people in need are able to access sustainable, quality meals. Turning food waste into community support, RePlate.
